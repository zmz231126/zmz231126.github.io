Vim supports persistent undo/redo, you can run undo/redo even from your previous sessions.","categories":[{"name":"编程","slug":"编程","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/"},{"name":"Vim","slug":"编程/Vim","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/Vim/"},{"name":"Vim 快捷键2","slug":"编程/Vim/Vim-快捷键2","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/Vim/Vim-%E5%BF%AB%E6%8D%B7%E9%94%AE2/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Vim","slug":"Vim","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Vim/"}]},{"title":"函数介绍2","slug":"text_string_post","date":"2024-04-09T10:22:00.000Z","updated":"2024-04-12T03:37:44.380Z","comments":true,"path":"2024/04/09/text_string_post/","permalink":"http://example.com/2024/04/09/text_string_post/","excerpt":"","text":"help() help() 是python中的内置函数, 使用它可以可以查询函数的用法.但是当我们使用help()来查询自定义函数的时候，它无法显示函数的说明，只能显示函数的结构，比如： 1234def fn(a): return 10help(fn) 返回值为Help on function fn in module __main__: 如果我们想返回函数的说明，就要在函数中添加文本字符串。比如 1234567891011def fn(a,b,c):&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;这是一个文档字符串实例函数的作用是：函数的参数：a.作用，类型，默认值...b.作用，类型，默认值...c.作用，类型，默认值...&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; return 10help(fn) 此时就会返回三个引号内的内容。我们也在参数后边加上参数的类型，比如def fn(a:int,b:bool,c:str) 作用域(scope) 指的是变量生效的区域，比如 123456def fn(): a = 10 print(a)# 调用函数fn() 此时就会返回10 我们调用函数，就是输出a，是因为变量和输出都是在函数的作用域内。 python中的作用域分类两种： 全局作用域 全局作用域在程序执行时创建，在程序执行结束时销毁。 所有函数以外的区域就是全局作用域。 在全局作用域中定义的变量就是全局变量，全局变量可以在程序的任意位置被访问。 函数作用域 在函数调用时创建， 在调用结束时销毁。 函数没调用一次，就会产生一个新的函数作用域。 在函数作用域中定义的变量，都是局部变量，它只能在函数内部被访问。 12345678b = 20 # 全局变量def fn(): a = 10 # 10局部变量 print(a) # 只能在函数内部被访问 print(b) # 可以在任意位置被访问# 调用函数fn() 此时返回结果为10 20 3. 当我们使用变量时，优先在当前作用域中寻找此变量，如果没有，则继续在上一级的作用域中去寻找。如果在全局变量中依然没找到，则返回NameError。 123456789b = 20def fn(): a = 10 b = 30 print(a) print(b)# 调用函数fn() 此时返回结果为10 30。 4. 如果希望在函数内部使用同名的全局变量，可以使用global关键字。比如 12345678910b = 20def fn(): a = 10 global b b = 5 print(a) print(b)# 调用函数fn() 此时返回10 5 命名空间(space) 命名空间就是变量的存储位置，每一个变量都需要存储到指定的命名空间中。每一个作用域都会有一个它对应的命名空间。 命名空间实际上就是一个字典，是一个专门专门用来存储变量的字典。 使用locals()来获取当前作用域的命名空间。它返回的是一个字典 global()函数可以用来在任意位置获取我们的全局命名空间 递归 阶乘 12341! = 1*1 =12! = 1*2 =23! = 1*2*3 =64! = 1*2*3*4 =24 求10的阶乘 1234n = 10for i in range(1,10): # range函数包含开始不包含结束 n *= iprint(n) 创建一个函数，求任意数的阶乘。 12345678910def factorial(a): &#x27;&#x27;&#x27; 该函数用来求任意数的阶乘 参数n是任意数 &#x27;&#x27;&#x27; n = a for i in range(1,a): n *= i return n 递归式函数 递归式函数就是在函数中自己调用自己. 递归函数的两个要件： 基线条件：问题继续分解的条件 递归条件：","categories":[{"name":"编程","slug":"编程","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/"},{"name":"python基础","slug":"编程/python基础","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/python%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80/"}],"tags":[{"name":"python","slug":"python","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/python/"}]},{"title":"vim shortcuts","slug":"vim基础知识post","date":"2024-04-08T16:00:00.000Z","updated":"2024-05-12T16:11:15.690Z","comments":true,"path":"2024/04/09/vim基础知识post/","permalink":"http://example.com/2024/04/09/vim%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86post/","excerpt":"","text":"jump to the top of the file gg jump to the end of the file G $ vim +33 my_file.txt, the cursor will be positioned on the line 33 for the first file you open In Vim, the -c cmd option allows you to execute a command after the first file has been read. This can be useful for automating tasks or customizing Vim’s behavior when opening a file. Here’s how you can use the -c cmd option in Vim: Open a file and run a command: You can open a file in Vim and run a command immediately after the file is loaded. For example, to open a file example.txt and jump to line 10, you can use the following command: vim -c &quot;normal 10G&quot; example.txt This command will open example.txt in Vim and move the cursor to line 10. Run multiple commands: You can also chain multiple commands using the -c option. Separate each command with a semicolon ;. For example, to open a file and set syntax highlighting to a specific type, you can use: vim -c &quot;set syntax=python&quot; -c &quot;normal G&quot; example.py This command will open example.py in Vim, set the syntax highlighting to Python, and move the cursor to the end of the file. Execute an Ex command: You can execute Ex commands (commands that start with 😃 using the -c option. For example, to open a file and save it with a different name, you can use: ​ vim -c &quot;:w newfile.txt&quot; example.txt This command will open example.txt in Vim and save it as newfile.txt. Using the -c cmd option in Vim provides flexibility in automating tasks or customizing Vim's behavior when opening files. You can experiment with different commands to suit your specific requirements.","categories":[{"name":"编程","slug":"编程","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/"},{"name":"Vim","slug":"编程/Vim","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/Vim/"},{"name":"Vim快捷键1","slug":"编程/Vim/Vim快捷键1","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/Vim/Vim%E5%BF%AB%E6%8D%B7%E9%94%AE1/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Vim","slug":"Vim","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Vim/"}]},{"title":"字典","slug":"函数简介","date":"2024-04-06T11:59:00.000Z","updated":"2024-04-12T03:37:44.381Z","comments":true,"path":"2024/04/06/函数简介/","permalink":"http://example.com/2024/04/06/%E5%87%BD%E6%95%B0%E7%AE%80%E4%BB%8B/","excerpt":"","text":"函数也是一个对象.

称为映射(mapping) 字典的作用和列表类似, 都是存储对象的容器 列表存储数据的性能良好, 但是查询数据的性能很差. 字典中, 每一个元素都有一个唯一的名字, 通过这个名字可以快速查到指定的元素, 它相当于列表的索引, 但是这个名字更好记忆. 在查询元素时, 字典的效率很快 字典中可以存储多个对象, 每个对象都有一个唯一的名字key. 这个对象称为value 字典又称为key-value结构. 一个key-value称为一个item 使用&#123;&#125;创建字典, my_dict = {key:value,key:value}. value可以是任意类型数据, key可以使任意的不可变对象, 一般会使用str. 字典的key是 不能重复的, 如果重复, 后边的项(item)会替换前边的项. 我们可以多行编写字典, 这样看起来更加清晰. 字典的使用 我们还可以使用dict()函数来创建字典: 比如： d = dict(name=‘孙悟空’,age=18,gender=‘男’) output 为:&#123;'name': '孙悟空', 'age': 18, 'gender': '男'&#125;,这里可以看到，自动为age 加上了引号。 这种方式创建的字典，它的key都是字符串。 双值序列，序列中只有两个值，比如[1,2],(‘a’,3),‘ab’. 子序列，如果序列中的元素也是序列，我们称这个元素为子序列。比如：[(1,2),(2,5)]&gt;这里，我们在列表里放了两个元组，那么这两个元组就是双值子序列。 双值子序列，就是子序列中只有两个值。 dict()函数可以将双值子序列转换为字典。比如： d = dict([(‘name’,‘孙悟空’),(‘age’,18)])。output为：&#123;'name':'孙悟空','age':18&#125; len()函数获取字典中item的个数。 in/not检查字典中是否包含指定的key， 根据key获取值，语法为：d[key]. 另一种为get()方法。d.get(‘key’,‘默认值’)，当获取不到值时，返回默认值。 修改字典 如果存在 my_dict[key] = newvalue 修改 如果不存在, 则会添加. my_dict.setdefault(“key”,“value”)如果字典中存在对应的key, 则没有影响, 如果没有, 就添加默认item update()方法,my_dict.update(my_dict2),将my_dict2中的item加到my_dict里边. 如果发现重复key my_dict2会替换my_dict1 popitem()方法. 随机删除一个键值对(一般是最后一个). 删除后, 有返回值(两个元素的元组). pop(key,optional default value)method. delete the item according to the key arguments. it will return a value. if you set a

序列是Python中最基本的一种数据结构, 数据结构是计算机中数据存储的方式. 序列拥抱保存一种 有序的数据, 所以我们可以理解索引的概念. 序列分为两类: 可变序列: 序列中的元素可以改变 列表 不可变序列: 元素不可改变 字符串 元组 列表（list） 列表是一个对象. 以前我们学习的对象比如数值，只能保存一个数据， 而列表可以存储多个数据。 如何创建列表 通过[]创建一个列表比如my_list = []. 列表中存储的数据我们叫做元素. 列表中的元素可以是一个或者多个, 元素之间用,隔开. 列表可以保存任意对象比如数值, 字符串, 布尔值, 逻辑值. 各个元素是按照顺序存到列表中的. 列表名称一般用复数. 获取列表元素(所有序列均适用) 索引 索引表示的是元素在列表中的位置. 索引是从0开始的整数, 0对应的是列表中的第一个元素 可以通过索引来调用列表中的元素, 语法规则为listname[indexnumber] 可以通过len()获取列表的长度. 列表长度是最大索引+1. 索引可以用负数, 从后往前获取元素, -1表示倒数第一个. 切片 切片是指从现有的列表中, 获取一个子列表. 语法为listname[startindexnumber:endindexnumber] 切片会包含开始元素, 不包含结束元素. 切片总是会返回一个新地列表, 不回影响原来地列表. 开始位置和结束位置可以任意省略一个. 切片还可以加入步长.表示间隔, 默认为1, 步长也可以为负数, 用法比如: 12students =

通用操作 +可以将列表合并为一个列表 *可以将列表重复, 生成一个新列表 in / not in检查元素是否存在指定列表中, 比如 print('tangseng' in students)返回True len()获取列表中元素的个数 min()获取列表中的最小值 max()获取列表中的最大值 这几个主要用于数值列表, 字符串比较utf8编码值, 没有意义. index()方法 方法和函数基本一样, 只是方法必须用对象.方法()调取. 方法必须用对象调用. 1print(students.index(&#x27;sunwukong&#x27;)) 返回0 如果元素不存在于列表(对象)会报错. 如果元素有相同的多个, 那么会返回第一个出现的元素的索引. index()后边还可以带两个可选参数. 两个参数指定查找的其实位置, 包括开始, 不包括结束. count()方法 统计元素出现次数的方法. 修改列表 通过索引修改 修改元素 123students = [&#x27;sunwukong&#x27;,&#x27;zhubajie&#x27;,&#x27;shaheshang&#x27;,&#x27;tangseng&#x27;,&#x27;zhizhujing&#x27;,&#x27;baigujing&#x27;]students[0] =

students[0:2] = [‘牛魔王’,‘红孩儿’,‘二郎神’] 把序列中前两个元素替换为这三个元素. students[0:0] = [‘牛魔王’] 在索引为0的元素前添加一个新元素. 当设置了步长时, 必须和切片中元素必须和序列中元素一致. 可以利用切片删除元素 del students[0:2] del students[::2] students[1:3] = [] 列表的方法 append(-) method向列表的最后添加一个元素. insert(index,_) method向列表的指定位置加入元素. 有两个参数: 第一个要插入的位置(原元素后移), 第二个为插入的新元素. extend([_,_,_])使用新的序列扩展当前序列. 类似append()method. clear()清空序列 pop(index)删除指定元素, 并返回被删除的元素. remove(_)删除指定元素, 相同元素有多个时, 删除第一个. reverse()将元素倒序. sort()对列表元素进行排序. 默认生序排列, 加入参数reverse = True时变为降序排列. 遍历列表 将列表中的所有元素都取出来. 可以通过while循环来遍历列表. 12345students =

连字：西文字体很多会出现连字现象，可以在字母间加上&#123;&#125;阻止这种情况 it’s dif{ }f{ }cult to f{ }ind \\ldots 西文中使用-组成复合词，使用--连接数字，使用---连接单词。 \\=a \\'a \\v a \\a` \\newline只能在文本段落中断行. \\\\可以在任何格式中断行，而且带一个可选参数，指定向下增加的垂直间距，\\\\\\*表示禁止在断行处分页。 在latex中输入latex命令使用\\verb|命令|来表示 断页的命令为\\newpage和\\clearpage.两者的不同在于双栏排版中，\\newpage为另起一栏的作用。 告诉latex哪里适合断行断页，哪里不允许断行断页，可以使用命令\\linebreak[]``\\nolinebreak[] \\pagebreak[]和nopagebreak[]后边的参数填写1-4，表示适合或者不适合的程度。 在西文排版实践中，断行的位置优先选取在两个单词之间，也就是在源代码中输入的“空格”。 文字在单词间的“空格”处断行时，“空格”生成的间距随之舍去。 可以使用字符~ 输入一个不会断行的空格比如Donald~E. 很长的英文单词，会考虑从单词中间自动换行，我们可以给latex参考建议，在哪里换行比较合适，命令为\\- 1\\section[目录中显示的标题]&#123;页眉中显示的标题&#125; 在这个示例中，方括号内的文本是可选参数，用于指定在目录中显示的标题，而花括号内的文本是实际章节标题。这样可以使目录中显示的标题与页眉中显示的标题不同。 在需要进行引用的位置比如：章节标题、行间公式、有序列表、图表标题和定理环境中使用\\label命令，在需要引用过的位置\\ref&#123;labelname&#125;~\\pageref&#123;labelname&#125;引用就可以了。 在需要插入脚注的地方写\\footnote&#123;脚注内容&#125;就可以了。在各种盒子内，比如表格，可能不能生成正确的脚注，可以在插入脚注地方写\\footnotemark&#123;脚注内容&#125;,然后在合适的位置用\\footnotetext生成就可以了。 \\marginpar[左边注]&#123;右边注&#125;可以进行边注。不设置左边注，则奇偶页文字相同，设置了左边注，则偶数页就使用左边注。 列表环境有两个\\begin&#123;enumerate&#125; and \\begin&#123;itemize&#125;两个都用\\item表明列表相，\\item[]可选参数，可以自定义符号。 无需列表的符号可以由\\labelitemi and \\labelitemv定义\\labelitemi, labelitemii, labelitemiii, labelitemv共四级列表。 有序列表的符号由\\labelenumi到\\labelenumv定义。 对齐由三个环境center, flushleft, flushright \\verb| |可以显示原始文本，而不受解释器的影响。分界线一般使用|但不是必须的，出了星号、空格和字母外的任何字符。 另外三个命令也可以实现对齐\\centering, \\raggedleft, \\raggedright通常，对齐环境使用在文本中，而对齐命令使用在浮动体环境中。 引用环境较一般文字有额外的左右缩进。quote环境首行不缩进，quotation首行缩进。verse环境会使首行悬挂伸出。 代码环境使用\\verbatim其中\\verbatim*可以是代码中的空格显示为ㄩ更加直观。 简短的代码或者关键字可以用\\verb命令。 另外更常见的写代码是使用\\lstlisting命令，在导言区域加入usepackage&#123;listings&#125;宏包，并设置代码格式比如 12345678910\\lstset&#123; language=Python, basicstyle=\\ttfamily, keywordstyle=\\color&#123;blue&#125;, commentstyle=\\color&#123;green&#125;, numbers=left, numberstyle=\\tiny, numbersep=5pt, breaklines=true&#125; 表格列格式，arry宏包。 在LaTeX中，&gt;{}和&lt;{}这样的语法用于对表格中的列进行格式化。在这个例子中，&gt;{\\itshape}表示对该列中的内容应用斜体格式，而&lt;{*}表示该列的内容采用默认的格式。 具体来说： - &gt;{\\itshape}将该列中的文本内容应用斜体格式。 - &lt;{*}表示该列的内容采用默认的格式。 插入图片使用graphicx宏包，然后在导言去插入命令指定位置\\graphicspath&#123;同文件下专门设立图片文件夹路径为img/}。在插入地方输入命令\\includegraphics&#123;图片名称.后缀&#125;注意图片名为英文。 如果在同目录中设立了两个多个子文件夹，可以使用\\graphicspath&#123;&#123;img/&#125;&#123;logo/&#125;&#125;指定。同是这里可以使用绝对路径指定任意位置的文件夹，比如图片在桌面，可以使用\\graphicspath&#123;&#123;/Users/ken/Desktop/&#125;&#125;表示。 \\includegraphics可以带一个参数width, height, scale, angle.比如设定宽度为0.8倍该行文字宽，\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]&#123;ThisPic&#125; \\mbox可以设定一个文本框，makebox等同但是可以带两个参数指定盒子的宽度和里边文本的对齐方式，比如\\makebox[10em][l/r/c/s]&#123;文本内容&#125;其中s表示分散对齐。 \\fbox and \\framebox会为文本框加上边框，可以使用\\setlength设定边框的宽度，比如\\setlength&#123;fboxrule&#125;&#123;1pt&#125;和\\setlength&#123;\\fboxsep&#125;&#123;1em&#125; 以上两种文本款内的文本不能换行，如果要换行使用另一种盒子，\\parbox这种盒子跟\\makebox不同，\\parbox[和周围环境的对齐方式tbc][高度][文本对齐方式tbcs]&#123;盒子宽度&#125;&#123;文本&#125; \\parbox内部只能使用footnotemark+footnotetext&#123;&#125;命令 \\minipage环境与\\parbox命令作用一样，可以使用\\footnote脚注,但是是单独成块。 \\rule命令可以用来画一个实心矩形\\rule[上浮或下浮]&#123;width&#125;&#123;height&#125;.还可以用它来画线 \\rule[-.4pt]&#123;3em&#125;&#123;.4pt&#125; 浮动体有两种table and figure.两者设置同理，参数为h(当前位置)t顶部b底部p单独成页！在决定位置时忽视限制。 双栏排版时，浮动题命令为\\table*和\\figure*。但是参数只能有tb两个位置。 在浮动环境中加上\\caption[目录中的标题]&#123;标题&#125;生成图表标题并自动编号，如果不要编号，同\\section*生成不带编号的浮动体。紧跟\\caption命令后，可以\\label&#123;&#125;方便引用。 使\\renewcommand&#123;\\figurename&#125;&#123;标题&#125;更改默认的标题前缀。 使用\\listoftables生成类似目录页的单独的浮动体目录。 行内公式使用$ $包裹，行间公式使用equation环境，不带编号的行间公式使用equation*包裹。 使用\\label&#123;&#125;和\\eqref&#123;&#125;引用公式 \\tag&#123;&#125;命令修改编号，\\notag命令取消编号 公式环境中需要空格使用\\quad and \\qquad 公式中使用文本需要引入\\text&#123;&#125;命令。 省略号使用\\ldots \\vdots \\ddots 上标使用^下标使用_上下标中的子公式使用&#123;&#125;包围。 分数使用\\frac&#123;分子&#125;&#123;分母&#125;行内公式使用\\tfrac&#123;&#125;&#123;&#125;. 根式使用\\sqrt[次]&#123;根数&#125;。 \\ne, \\ge, \\le, \\approx, \\sim, \\equiv, \\propto \\times, \\div, \\cdot, \\pm, \\mp \\dot&#123;&#125; \\ddot&#123;&#125; \\vec&#123;&#125; \\hat&#123;&#125; \\overline&#123;&#125; \\underline&#123;&#125; \\overrightarrow&#123;&#125; \\overbrace&#123;&#125; and \\underbrace&#123;&#125;生成上下大括号，可以带一个上下标公式。 \\xleftarrow&#123;&#125; and \\xrightarrow&#123;&#125;可以伸缩的箭头，并且可以增加上下标。 字体加粗\\textbf&#123;&#125;。数学公式中使用\\mathbf&#123;&#125;. 字体命令\\textrm&#123;&#125;, \\textsf&#123;&#125;,\\textit&#123;&#125;,\\textsl&#123;&#125;, textup&#123;&#125;, \\texttt&#123;&#125;, \\emph&#123;&#125; 字号命令, &#123;\\tiny&#125;, &#123;\\scriptsize&#125;, &#123;\\footnotesize&#125;, &#123;\\samll&#125;, &#123;\\normalsize&#125;,&#123;\\large&#125;, &#123;\\Large&#125;,&#123;\\LARGE&#125;,&#123;\\huge&#125; 另外精确指定字号大小的命令是&#123;\\footsize&#123;字号&#125;&#123;行距&#125;\\selectfont 文本&#125;。放在导言区，可以不用\\selectfont xelatex支持调用调用fontspec宏包，可以在导言区设置全局字体：\\setmainfont&#123;font name&#125;&#123;font features&#125;; \\setsansfont&#123;&#125;&#123;&#125;;\\setmonofont&#123;&#125;&#123;&#125; ctex宏包中中文字体使用\\setCJKmainfont&#123;&#125;&#123;&#125;。ctex自动调用fontspec宏包 使用fontspec宏包会覆盖数学字体。需要数学字体时使用，在fontspec宏包中指定no-math. 或者在\\documentclass命令里指定no-math. \\underline&#123;&#125;生成下划线.调用ulem宏包，启用 \\uline生成下划线。 长度变量可以被赋值使用 \\setlength&#123;\\length command&#125;&#123;length&#125;进行赋值。 设置行距我们一般不用 \\fontsize, 更多使用 \\linespread&#123;&#125;,基础行距时字号的1.2倍。如果设置成 \\linespread&#123;1.5&#125;那就是说行距设置成了1.8倍字号大小。 如果不是在导言区， 可以跟上 \\selectfont来改变后边文本的行距。 行距设置是在分段时才生效的，字号是立即生效的，段落缩进分段时生效的。 段落首行缩进使用 \\setlength&#123;\\parindent&#125;&#123;length&#125;. 段落间距使用 \\setlength&#123;\\parskip&#125;&#123;length&#125; \\hspace&#123;&#125;在单词后边生成一段空白，但是会随着断行而被舍弃，\\hspace*&#123;&#125;水平间距不随断行舍弃。参数里边可以写 \\stretch&#123;n&#125;里边的n为权重，同一行出现多个 \\stretch&#123;&#125;时n就有作用了, 参数填写\\fill相当于 \\stretch&#123;1&#125; 增加垂直间距使用 \\vspace他的用法和 \\hspace 相同。 另外可以使用 \\bigskip, \\medskip, smallskip紧跟在 \\par之后用来增加段落间距。","categories":[{"name":"编程","slug":"编程","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/"},{"name":"Latex","slug":"编程/Latex","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/Latex/"}],"tags":[{"name":"LaTeX","slug":"LaTeX","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/LaTeX/"}]},{"title":"流程控制","slug":"if语句","date":"2024-03-31T16:00:00.000Z","updated":"2024-04-05T00:54:48.249Z","comments":true,"path":"2024/04/01/if语句/","permalink":"http://example.com/2024/04/01/if%E8%AF%AD%E5%8F%A5/","excerpt":"","text":"Python代码是按照自上而下执行的.

type 当前对象所属的类型, 类型决定了对象的功能. 比如自行车那它有什么功能, 牛有哪些功能. type()查看类型 同样, 类型同样无法更改 value 对象所存储的数据. 我们平时直接看到的就是对象的值. id和type要用函数才能看到. 值有些对象能改变, 有些不能改变. 变量和对象 a = 3 这里的’3’是一个对象, 它有上部分提到的三部分构成. 对象并不是存储在变量中,

Knuth 1982年发布Tex引擎，1989年位更好的支出8-bit字符和多语言排版而予以改进。 LaTex是一种使用Tex程序作为排版引擎的格式（format）。可以错略的理解为是对Tex的一层封装。起初有Leslie Lamport博士开发，目前又LaTex工作组进行维护。 LaTex命令和代码结构 命令两种形式： \\和后面的一串字母，如\\LaTex。以任意非字母符号为界限。 \\反斜线和后面单个非字母符号，比如\\$. 注意⚠️ 字母形式的LaTex忽略其后的所有连续空格，如果要引入空格，应该写成\\LaTex&#123;&#125;。 LaTex大小写敏感。 【参数】一些命令可以接受参数，参数影响命令的效果。参数有： mandatory arguments，用&#123;&#125;包裹。 optional arguments，用[]包裹。 *带一个星号和不带星号的命令效果有差异。可以把星号看作一种特殊的可选参数。 【环境】环境成对出现，环境有时会携带参数，环境名保持一致。部分环境允许嵌套。比如 1234\\begin&#123;enviroment name&#125;[optional arguments]&#123;mandatory arguments&#125;……\\end&#123;enviroment name&#125; % 这里不在需要写参数 【分组】LaTex使用&#123;&#125;作为分组。分组中效果命令被限制在分组内。修改字体字号的命令即属此类。 LaTex 源码结构： 12345\\documentclass&#123;&#125; % 指定文档的文档类% 导言区。一般会在这里调用宏包和对文档进行全局设置。\\begin&#123;document&#125;% 正文内容\\end&#123;document&#125; 文档类和宏包 文档类： LaTex中的三个表中文档类：article, report, book. 在此基础上派生的一类文档如中文排版的ctexart, ctexrep, ctexbook. 可选参数： 为文档类指定选项，全局规定一些排版参数，如字号、纸张大小、单双面。 1\\documentclass[11pt,twoside,a4paper]&#123;article&#125; 三个标准文档类的可指定选项包括： 字号：10pt, 11pt, 12pt。默认10pt。 纸张大小：a4paper, letter paper, 等等。 单双面：twoside, oneside. 双面排版时，奇偶页的页眉页脚、页边距不同。article和report默认为单面。book默认为双面。 单栏双栏：onecolumn, twocolume. 默认是 onecolumn. 新一章在起始位置：openright, openany. 指定新一章是否必须从奇数页开始（右侧）。默认article无效；report为openany；book为openright。 横向排版还是纵向排版：landscape. 默认为纵向。 标题是否单独成页：titleapge, notitlepage. article默认为不单独成页。report和book默认为单独成页。 草稿/终稿：draft, final.草稿模式小，不良断行会在行尾条件一个黑色方块。默认为final. 行间公式左对齐： fleqn，行间公式左对齐。默认居中对齐。 公式编号放左边：leqno，公式编号放左边，默认放右边。 宏包：调用宏包的命令usepackage[options]&#123;package name&#125; 可以一次调用多个宏包，中间用逗号隔开。此时一般不指定选项。 文件的组织方式 将源文件分割成若干个文件，比如每章的目录放在单独的文件中，会大大缩短修改和校对时间。 LaTex中向源代码中插入文件的命令： \\include&#123;filename&#125;，filename不带扩展名。如果和要编译的主文件不在同一个目录，要加上相对或者绝对路径。通过include引入的文件，在读入后会另起一页。如果不要另起一页可以用input命令。 \\input&#123;filename&#125;。当导言区内容较多时，可以单独放置在一个.tex文档，在用\\input&#123;&#125;插入。 相关术语 【引擎】又称为编译器，是编译源码并生成文档的程序。如pdftex, xetex等。 【格式】是定义了一组命令的代码集。LaTex是最广泛应用的一个格式。比如plain Tex格式，没有定义诸如\\documentclass和\\section等等命令。 【编译命令】是实际调用的、结合了引擎和格式的命令。xelatex命令是结合了xetex引擎和latex格式的一个编译命令。 调用syntaxonly 可以只编译文档而不生成PDF文档，我们如果只是想检查错误可以使用 \\usepackage&#123;syntaxonly&#125; \\syntaxonly","categories":[{"name":"编程","slug":"编程","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/"},{"name":"Latex","slug":"编程/Latex","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/Latex/"}],"tags":[{"name":"LaTeX","slug":"LaTeX","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/LaTeX/"}]}],"categories":[{"name":"编程","slug":"编程","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/"},{"name":"Vim","slug":"编程/Vim","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/Vim/"},{"name":"Vim快捷键3","slug":"编程/Vim/Vim快捷键3","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/Vim/Vim%E5%BF%AB%E6%8D%B7%E9%94%AE3/"},{"name":"Vim快捷键5","slug":"编程/Vim/Vim快捷键5","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/Vim/Vim%E5%BF%AB%E6%8D%B7%E9%94%AE5/"},{"name":"Vim快捷键6","slug":"编程/Vim/Vim快捷键6","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/Vim/Vim%E5%BF%AB%E6%8D%B7%E9%94%AE6/"},{"name":"Vim快捷键4","slug":"编程/Vim/Vim快捷键4","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/Vim/Vim%E5%BF%AB%E6%8D%B7%E9%94%AE4/"},{"name":"python","slug":"python","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/python/"},{"name":"python基础","slug":"python/python基础","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/python/python%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80/"},{"name":"Vim 快捷键2","slug":"编程/Vim/Vim-快捷键2","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/Vim/Vim-%E5%BF%AB%E6%8D%B7%E9%94%AE2/"},{"name":"python基础","slug":"编程/python基础","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/python%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80/"},{"name":"Vim快捷键1","slug":"编程/Vim/Vim快捷键1","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/Vim/Vim%E5%BF%AB%E6%8D%B7%E9%94%AE1/"},{"name":"python","slug":"编程/python","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/python/"},{"name":"python基础","slug":"编程/python/python基础","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/python/python%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80/"},{"name":"Latex","slug":"编程/Latex","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/Latex/"},{"name":"制度学习","slug":"制度学习","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E5%88%B6%E5%BA%A6%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/"},{"name":"沙特环保制度","slug":"制度学习/沙特环保制度","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E5%88%B6%E5%BA%A6%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/%E6%B2%99%E7%89%B9%E7%8E%AF%E4%BF%9D%E5%88%B6%E5%BA%A6/"},{"name":"沙特工业园制度","slug":"制度学习/沙特工业园制度","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E5%88%B6%E5%BA%A6%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/%E6%B2%99%E7%89%B9%E5%B7%A5%E4%B8%9A%E5%9B%AD%E5%88%B6%E5%BA%A6/"},{"name":"沙特工业和矿产资源部制度","slug":"制度学习/沙特工业和矿产资源部制度","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/%E5%88%B6%E5%BA%A6%E5%AD%A6%E4%B9%A0/%E6%B2%99%E7%89%B9%E5%B7%A5%E4%B8%9A%E5%92%8C%E7%9F%BF%E4%BA%A7%E8%B5%84%E6%BA%90%E9%83%A8%E5%88%B6%E5%BA%A6/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Vim","slug":"Vim","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Vim/"},{"name":"python","slug":"python","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/python/"},{"name":"LaTeX","slug":"LaTeX","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/LaTeX/"},{"name":"Mac终端","slug":"Mac终端","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Mac%E7%BB%88%E7%AB%AF/"},{"name":"spyder快捷键","slug":"spyder快捷键","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/spyder%E5%BF%AB%E6%8D%B7%E9%94%AE/"},{"name":"计算机","slug":"计算机","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA/"},{"name":"Mac终端命令","slug":"Mac终端命令","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Mac%E7%BB%88%E7%AB%AF%E5%91%BD%E4%BB%A4/"},{"name":"环境变量","slug":"环境变量","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83%E5%8F%98%E9%87%8F/"},{"name":"计算机简介","slug":"计算机简介","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%AE%80%E4%BB%8B/"},{"name":"建厂","slug":"建厂","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/%E5%BB%BA%E5%8E%82/"},{"name":"沙特投资","slug":"沙特投资","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/%E6%B2%99%E7%89%B9%E6%8A%95%E8%B5%84/"},{"name":"沙特","slug":"沙特","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/%E6%B2%99%E7%89%B9/"},{"name":"沙特环境监察中心","slug":"沙特环境监察中心","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/%E6%B2%99%E7%89%B9%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83%E7%9B%91%E5%AF%9F%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83/"},{"name":"沙特工业园","slug":"沙特工业园","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/%E6%B2%99%E7%89%B9%E5%B7%A5%E4%B8%9A%E5%9B%AD/"},{"name":"工业许可证","slug":"工业许可证","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/%E5%B7%A5%E4%B8%9A%E8%AE%B8%E5%8F%AF%E8%AF%81/"},{"name":"沙特工业和矿产资源部","slug":"沙特工业和矿产资源部","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/%E6%B2%99%E7%89%B9%E5%B7%A5%E4%B8%9A%E5%92%8C%E7%9F%BF%E4%BA%A7%E8%B5%84%E6%BA%90%E9%83%A8/"},{"name":"工厂运营许可","slug":"工厂运营许可","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/%E5%B7%A5%E5%8E%82%E8%BF%90%E8%90%A5%E8%AE%B8%E5%8F%AF/"},{"name":"练习","slug":"练习","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/%E7%BB%83%E4%B9%A0/"}]}
